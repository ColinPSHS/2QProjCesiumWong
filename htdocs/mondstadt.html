            Mondstat is the Anemo region in the game. It is where all players start and are introduced to the game and
            its various mechanics. Mondstadt can be split into other areas such as Mondstadt City, Cider Lake, Falcon
            Coast, Cape Oath, Dawn Winery, Springvale, Thousand Winds Temple and Dragon Spine. Mondstadt in game is
            based on Germany
            in the real world having similar architecture
            and geography. Mondstadt is known as the City of Freedom where the citizen are to express it and have fun.
            Most citizens live free and by using the gift if wind from the Anemo Archon they use various gliders to fly
            around. Mondstadt is also known for poetry and its wine industry run by Diluc being a popular supplier of
            alchohol
            across Teyvat. Mondstadt is home to Dvalin a dragon and somewhat pet of the Anemo Archon which in the story
            is eventually helped by the traveller after being under control by the abyss. Mondstdat is also home to the
            knights of favonious. These knights compose of characters like Outrider Amber, Cavalry Captain Kaeya and
            Grandmaster Jean. Mondstadt has fought wars in the past, one to over throw the rulers of old Mondstadt and
            reclaim their freedom!

                This is Barbatos, the Anemo Archon of Mondstadt. He has the power to control the wind and he was the one
                who
                originally gave the power of flight to the birds and gave them the wind to fly on. Barbatos was not
                always the Anemo Archon and took the
                role
                after the previous one passed. His true form is pretty far from human as it looks more like an apple
                sized
                fairy that has a circular body. He got this form as a memento of his bard friend who passed after the
                war of
                Old Mondstadt. Now Barbatos roams around in Mondstadt in his curren form as shown on the right. To hide
                his
                identity he goes by the name Venti and leads a normal life. Today Venti is best known as a bard who
                performs on the streets of Mondstadt. He is also known for being a drunkard as he is usually hanging
                around inside the tavern. After the Dvalin issue was ressolved Barbatos had his gnosis, somewhat like a
                vision but holds great power, taken by a woman named La Signora, a fatui harbinger, after receiving a
                heavy beating. Without
                his gnosis he is quite weaker but still holds great power.

                Mondstat's topography show us that it is mostly comprised of hills and valleys. There are a bunch of
                plains
                too and has only one forest in Wolvendom. There are not may beaches or mountains in Mondstadt but there
                are many lakes and fields which embodies the freedom of open space. In mondstadt you can find their
                regional specialties used to upgrade certain character. These are the Calla Lilies, Cecilias, Dandelion
                Seeds, Philanemo Mushrooms, Small Lamp Grass, Valberries, Windwheel Asters and Wolfhook. These items can
                be found in specific areas for example Wolfhook only spawning in Wolvendom and Pihilanemo Mushrooms in
                Dawn Winery, Springvale and Mondstadt City.

                Dragonspine is one outlier of a sub region in Mondstadt as it was added later in the game (update 1.2).
                It was introduced as a fresh area of Mondstadt and came in with many new puzzles and areas to explore.
                Dragonspine is allso divided into sub areas such as the Entombed City, Skyfrost Nail, Starglow Cavern
                and Wyrmrest Valley. Dargonspine is very different as it is the only one to include the sheer cold
                effect which makes the traveler gradually colder and when the traveler is too cold they will start to
                freeze to death. This area is one of the most dangerous as it requires the traveler to keep a watch on
                their sheer cold bar. However, this area is home to some good resources and fine weapons.

            <h2>Trivia</h2>

        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Mondstadt is inspired by mainly German culture as well as various other Northern European cultures.
                </li>
                <li>Many of Mondstadt's characters have German names or titles: Klee means "clover" in German. Fischl,
                    the Prinzessin der Verurteilung means "Princess of Condemnation". Albedo, the Kreideprinz means
                    "Prince of Chalk". Diona of KÃ¤tzlein bloodline means "Kitten" bloodline.</li>
                <li>Mondstadt considers its trademarks the Dandelion, Flight and Wine, being the very few things that
                    Mondstadt learned from the Wind Archon to build Mondstadt.</li>
                <li>Many characters wear gloves that have a different color on the palm compared to the back. This could
                    be because the palm-side is made from a different material which provides better grip. It appears to
                    be a fashion unique to Mondstadt</li>
