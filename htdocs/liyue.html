            Liyue is the Geo region in the game and is the next accesible region after Mondstadt. Liyue has many sub
            areas such as Liyue Harbor, Mt. tianheng, Dihua Marsh, Wangshu Inn, Qingce Village and Jueyun Karst. Here
            Liyue in game is based on China in the real world sharing many geographical and cultural similarities. Liyue
            is known as
            the City of Contracts where most of the daily lives of the citizen revolve around contracts. Whether it be
            in commerce or in just keeping promises Liyue values their contracts. Liyue is known as the commerce center
            of Teyvat as it is where merchants form other regions some to trade. Liyue also has an abundance of mines
            and ores making it a great place to pick those up. Liyue is also home to a ground dragon known as Azhdaha
            who lives underground and is later defeated by the traveler and Zhongli. Here in Liyue they don't have a
            solid government but are run by the 7 most qualified buissiness people known as the Liyue QiXing (in Chinese
            qixing means 7 stars) and are watched over by powerful beings known as Adepti. Liyue hasn't been through as
            many wars as Mondstadt but have struggles through their own problems like floodings and famine.

            <p>
                This is Morax, the Geo Archon of Liyue. Morax has the power to control the earth and rocks
                and made some of the most incredible landmasses in Liyue such as Guyun Stone forest. Morax is also the
                one who created the mora, a currency in Teyvat, for the whole world, which is then stored in the Golden
                house. Morax's true form not actually human but he is a dragon. Morax took on this human form because of
                a revelation he made, being an Archon was lonely. he got tired of it eventually after several centuries
                and fakes his death. To hide
                his
                identity he goes by the name of Zhongli and works at a funeral parlor. Today Morax is known for his vast
                knowledge especialy in the rites of passing. After Osial had sunked once more Morax ends up giving away
                his gnosis, somewhat like a
                vision but holds great power, after forming a contract with La Signora. A man named Childe Tartaglia, a
                fatui harbinger, was
                also after his gnosis but was beaten to it by Signora, also a fatui harbinger. Without
                his gnosis he is weaker but is still very strong.

                In Liyue the topography is mostly high mountains and peaks with few plains in between. It is very
                notable that Liyue has hight mountains because these are the highest you can go in the game and can give
                amazing views of the lands below. Some mountains were actually created by Morax in the Archon war when
                he rained stone spears on his enemies. In liyue there are many regional specialties for upgrading
                characters, these are: Cor Lapis, Glaze Lilies, Jueyun Chilies, Noctilucous Jade, Qingxin, Silk Flowers,
                Starconches and Violetgrass. These materials are unique to certain areas like Corlapis in caves and
                mountain sides while Silk Flowers are found in Liyue Harbor and Wangshu Inn.

                <li>Liyue is the most prosperous of the seven nations.
                </li>
                <li>璃月 Líyuè is also a near homophone of "establishing a contract" (Chinese: 立约 lìyuē).
                    In-game lore defines the country Liyue (Chinese: 璃月 Líyuè) to be established in Guili Plain before
                    the Archon Wars while the Morax's mortal name "Zhongli" was chosen after the Seven. Thus the in-game
                    etymology of "Liyue" leads to deeper lore.</li>
                <li>Liyue is inspired by China.</li>
                <li>Liyue's Li (璃) can be decomposed into 王 wáng, "king" and 离 lí, "departure", which is the same li
                    found in Zhongli's name in Simplified Chinese. The yue (月) in Liyue can also mean "month,"
                    therefore, Liyue's name could possibly have a secondary meaning: "The Month of the King's
                    Departure," which bears striking similarity to a possible interpretation of Zhongli's name ("time of
                    departure").</li>
                <li>Morax, the founder of Liyue, quotes some proverbs from the Analects of Confucius in a (non-canon)
                    official blog post</li>
