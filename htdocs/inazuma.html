            Inazuma is the electro region in the game and the next region after Liyue Inazuma is split into 6
            islands:
            Narukami island, Kannazuka island, Yashiori island, Watatsumi island, Seirai island and Tsurumi island.
            Inazuma ingame is based on the real world Japan mostly in terms of culture and geogeaphy. Inazuma is
            known
            as the city of eternity. The citizens of Inazuma are set on eternalizing things like traditions and
            memories. In Inazuma there is trouble going on with the Vision Hunt Decree led by the Raiden Shogun.
            Visions
            are being taken away as visions, sometihng that can give supernatural power, is an enemy of the eternity
            of
            the shogun. Inazuma is lead solely by the Raiden Shogun or Electro Archon. Unlike the other archons,
            Raiden
            Shogun runs free and is less secretive about her identity. Inazuma is also lead by 3 commissions that
            being
            the Tenryou commission, the Yashiro commission and the Kanjou commission. The Tenryou commission is the
            most
            important as it is the executive arm of the Shogun.

                This is Raiden Shogun, the Electro Archon of Inazuma. Raiden Shogun is a master at manipulating
                electro
                and can even make whole thrunder storms out of this power. One notable feat of the Raiden Shogun is
                how
                she slayed a beast in one big slice and created a whole gorge. Like Barbatos, raiden Shogun was not
                always the Electro Archon and took over after the previous one had passed. This is indeed Raiden
                Shogun's true form and she goes around as a normal human. Unlike the other Archons, Raiden Shogun is
                very open about being the Electro Archon. Today Raiden is Known as the supreme ruler of Inazuma who
                manages the whole country even after the end of the Vision Hunt Decree. In order to save the
                traveler
                from Scaramouche, a fatui harbinger, an acomplice of the Shogun, Yae Miko, gave up the Gnosis of the
                Shogun in exchange for the traveler's life. Even without the Gnosis, Raiden Shogun is still very
                strong
                and still fights well.

                In Inazuma, it is mostly composed of mountains, forests and beaches. The forests in Inazuma are dark
                and
                barely any sun gets in, most notably the Chinju forest. Inazuma has many scattered beaches and
                mountains
                on each island. One gorge in particular, Musoujin Gorge was created by a single slash from the
                Raiden
                Shogun to slay a beast. Inazuma has its own regional specialties to upgrade various characters:
                Sakura
                Blooms, Dendrobium, Naku Weed, Sea Ganoderma, Onikabuto, Crystal Marrow, Amakumo Fruit, Sango Pearls
                and
                Flourecent Fungi. Most of these can be found in many places but things like Sango Pearls and
                Flourecent
                Fungi can only be found in Watasumi island and Tsurumi island respectively.

                <li>The Inazuma Shogunate, the ruling body of the country, is a direct reference to the same
                    government
                    used under the Japanese shogunate.
                </li>
                <li>A competition called "This Novel Is Amazing!" is held periodically in Inazuma, by the Yae
                    Publishing
                    House, a giant of the Inazuma publishing industry.</li>
                <li>Liyue is inspired by China.</li>
                <li>Inazuma is inspired by Japan. The name of the nation "Inazuma" (Japanese: 稲妻 Inazuma) means
                    "lightning" in Japanese..</li>
                <li>The Sakoku Decree of Inazuma and collection of Visions parallels the real-life sakoku policy
                    under
                    the Japanese Tokugawa shogunate.</li>
                <li>Names used in the Tsurumi Island are based on the Ainu language, spoken by the Ainu people, an
                    indigenous people in now the northern part of Japan (such as Hokkaido Island) and now the
                    southeasternmost part of Russia (such as Sakhalin Island).</li>
